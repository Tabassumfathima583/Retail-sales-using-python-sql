# 🛍️ Retail Sales Analysis — SQL + Python Project

This project explores customer shopping behavior using a real-world dataset of over **99,000 retail transactions**. It leverages SQL (via SQLite and SQLAlchemy) and Python (Pandas, Matplotlib) to extract business insights on **revenue trends, gender-based spending, mall performance, and category contributions**. The project concludes with a single-slide **PowerPoint poster** summarizing key findings.

- Who spends more: males or females?
- Which malls and product categories generate the most revenue?
